## Installation

Start by clone the project or download zip file.

```
git clone https://github.com/trdat123/new-language-ecommerce.git
```

Then `cd` to root folder and run `npm install` to install back-end. After that, `cd` into **client** folder and run `npm install` again to create **node_module** for front-end.

## Run on Local

On the root folder, you can run front-end or back-end seperately with `npm start` for back-end and `npm run start-client` for client. Or you can run both with `npm run dev`.

## Build project

On the root folder, run `npm run build-client` to bundle front-end with **Vite**. Only front-end are buildable.
